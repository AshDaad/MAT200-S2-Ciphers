In West Philadelphia born and raised 
On the playground is where I spent most of my days 
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool 
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school 
When a couple of guys who were up to no good 
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood 
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared 
And said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
